      Lintong coffee grows in the fertile lands of North Sumatra, near Lake Toba.
      Known for its earthy, herbal notes with a clean finish,
      this coffee tells the story of volcanic soils and centuries of tradition.

      The cool climate and high altitude create the perfect environment for
      slow ripening, allowing the beans to develop their signature character.
      Farmers in Lintong still rely on traditional methods such as wet-hulling,
      a unique process that contributes to the coffee’s bold and full-bodied taste.

      A cup of Lintong often carries hints of spice, tobacco, and cedar —
      flavors that reflect the dramatic landscape of rugged mountains and
      the deep cultural roots of the Batak people. Every sip feels like
      uncovering a hidden story from the heart of Sumatra.

      Today, Lintong remains a favorite among coffee enthusiasts worldwide,
      not only for its distinctive taste but also for the resilience and
      dedication of the farming communities who keep the tradition alive.

      Local farmers carefully handpick ripe cherries and process them
      with a focus on consistency. Their dedication not only preserves

      of West Java's coffee-growing tradition.

      world-class origins. Whether enjoyed as a pure espresso shot
      or in a silky cappuccino, this coffee delivers sweetness,
